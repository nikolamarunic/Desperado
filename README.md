# Desperado
A 2D Cowboy game developed in Android Studio with three stages. Involved programming logic for stages, login and user details, and high score tracking. Heavy focus on code design and design patterns in particular.

# Setup (credit: Faaris Ali)

Ensure that you have Android Studio, Android API 29 SDK, and a compatible phone or Android Virtual Device installed. I used the Pixel 3 with API 28 as my AVD (Android Virtual Device).

To setup the project, go to Android Studio and on the welcome page, click Check out project from Version Control and paste this project's Git URL into the given prompt.

Then, it will ask you if you would like to create an Android Studio project. Select Yes. Click next until it asks you if you want to overwrite a module file. Select Overwrite. Then select the project SDK as Android API 29 Platform. Click next, and then Finish.

Then Android Studio will open a new project. Near the top left, go to File > Open, then in the pop up, go to, [directory that you cloned the project into] > phase2 > Game, and under the Game directory, double click on build.grade You should then see another window launched by Android Studio.

This should commence the building the process. After building, click run with your choice of device as the app installation target. Again, I use the Pixel 3 AVD running with API 28.

# Game Overview
